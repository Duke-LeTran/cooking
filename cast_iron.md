# General Notes
* Season cast iron skillet if it is new or new-to-you (may be rusty and old)
* Water will make the cast iron rust -- keep it dry when possible
* Requires preheating
* doesn't necessarily heat evenly, but keeps the heat really well 
* cast iron is a great conductor of heat
* don't cook acidic foods (tomato sauce, wine, or vinegar)
* high heat is ok (great for steaks!)

# I. Maintenance
## A. Clean
1. Scrub with steel wool and mild soap
2. Rinse off hot water
3. scrub again with non-abrasive scrubber (green) wit hot water
4. dry off with towel
5. Boil off all water (to prevent rust)
Result: It should look rusty at this point still but clean.
## B. Season
1. Use a paper towel and rub with canola or flaxseed oil # gets oil into porous holes to make nice smooth looking surface
2. Use a paper towel and wipe off as much oil as MUCH as possible
3. Bake at 450 or 500 degree F (this is to cook a past smoking point and )
Result: glassy non-stick layer (if it's still sticky, it wasn't hot enough)

# II. Cooking
1. Preheat on low-to-medium for 5-10 minutes
2. Don't put cold food in cold pan
3. Don't move food around too much (like meat); meat will self-release when brown carmelized crust is formed

# III. Cleaning
1. Clean soon when it's cool enough or else food will adhere and stick to pan (don't use cold or you may risk cracking it)
2. Use the following:
	* hot water 
	* salt (works as an abrasive, helps scrub off)
	* non-metal scouring pad (green rough side of sponge)
3. Make it dry off on stove (to protect it from rust)
4. With paper towel, rub a protective layer of oil all along the inside
5. Turn up the heat until smoking (so oil doesn't turn rancid)
